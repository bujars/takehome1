# Key thing to note
# The machine code for the label in the conditional branch is given as the distance between the label and that instruction. 
# That is, the number of instructions between the two. IN this case it would be 2, ie add and j. 
# The machine code for the label in the uncondiitonal branch is given as the address of the machine instruction (that we would jump to).
# Notice the differenece between the two!
